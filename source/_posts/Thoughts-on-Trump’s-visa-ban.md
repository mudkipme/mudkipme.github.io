My belief is that the world must keep religion out of politics and laws. Any religion views that disrespect women, LGBTQ, atheists or other minorities, or disrespect the freedom of speech, drinking or sex, or choices of food, lifestyle or birth, should be get rid of. Those who where shouting about pro-life nonsense are the same kind of people as islamists.

It’s right for any countries to prevent religious extremism, but punishing all people of certain countries is a terrible idea. I feel bad for atheists, LGBTQs, secular Muslims and Christians in these countries. And as someone living in a country whose rulers have different values than the western world (and myself), I’m a bit frustrated.

It’s right to push western values, aka, universal values forward (I don’t think Trump is a believer of western values, but I still think most American, and even most Republicans are.), and it’s right to fight back. But there are better ways to do that. Instead of punishing people of certain countries, protecting people of those countries is a much better idea, like what a Republican president, George H. W. Bush, did many years ago.
