I bought a Sonos One yesterday. Here are my first impressions:

* Sound quality is amazing. It's tremendously better than all Bluetooth speakers I have owned.
* Alexa is great. But slower than Siri. (Possibly due to my Internet connection)
* [Pikachu Talk](https://www.pokemon.com/us/app/pikachu-talk/) is a killing feature. It's fantastic.
* Plex integration is fine but Plex + Alexa is unsupported. Navigating Plex library is slower than iOS apps.
* Pocket Casts is supported but no smart speed.
* Importing music library from SMB is great, and navigating is blazing fast.
* No local music services when using Alexa. (Because of region settings)
* I *can*, however, use AirPlay, by just run [airsonos](https://github.com/justintime/docker-airsonos) on my Synology NAS with Docker. It works fine but there is a 4 seconds latency. It's OK to play music or podcasts. But it can't be used to play video as the video and sound won't be in sync. AirPlay 2 is coming soon hopefully.
* Alexa can control my Yeelight by enabling its Skill and changing the Yeelight server location to Singapore.
