Last week I played through the true ending of _[Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/999:_Nine_Hours,_Nine_Persons,_Nine_Doors)_. It's an excellent story and adventure. The 4-leaf clover bookmark is my favorite part in this game, which means hope, faith, love and luck.

> No matter what happens, you can never lose **hope**. You have to remember what's most important, and that's to have **faith**, and to have **love**. If you can remember all of those, that'll bring you good **luck**.

I cried when Junpei gives the bookmark to Clover. That moment changes everything, and everyone is saved because of their hope, faith and love.

We can never lose _hope_.
