> It's not necessary... Separating black from white and humans from Pokémon! If you think in terms of each individual life, this world was in a state that couldn't divided any further. Possibilities are born out of combining and fusing these different lives! There are some things we can understand only by doing this. It will give form to unseen things. These formulae will restructure the world and make it richer! From their Poké Balls, I can hear the many different feelings Pokémon have about their Trainers. More than anything, I can hear their joy that they met people who need them!
