The Internet has became one of the essential parts of my life since late last century. I still remember many things in the early days of my Internet life, when I was still a elementary or junior middle school child.

There are two things essentially formed my worldview, letting me know what this world is really like, whether I was told or learned from textbooks is true or false.

The first one is when I was in an Internet cafe in March 2000. That day many people there kept refreshing the Traditional Chinese version of Yahoo news, because there was a major election across the strait. I was interested and also enlightened.

The second one is, reading an article on Wikipedia. Wikipedia was still young and incomplete at that time, but that article was quite detailed and convictive. I was shocked.

As the years went by, I still remember.
