    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This post is inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://neilzone.co.uk/2024/10/10-things-i-find-joyful-about-computers-and-the-internet-in-2024/">Neil Brown</a>. Being mostly a pessimistic person, I often find myself worrying about the negative impact of technological developments in recent years. However, I’m still trying my best to find joy in the things I care about throughout the year.</p>
<h3 id="Wayland-and-NVIDIA-on-Linux-Have-Improved-Massively">Wayland and NVIDIA on Linux Have Improved Massively</h3>
<p>2024 has been my year of the Linux desktop. At the start of the year, I still had to rely on <a href="https://mudkip.me/2024/03/28/Notes-on-EndeavourOS/">numerous workarounds</a> to deal with frustrating issues on my desktop PC caused by NVIDIA’s lackluster Wayland support. However, NVIDIA’s driver improvements throughout the year—especially with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2024/04/05/explicit-sync.html">explicit sync</a>—along with advancements in Wayland protocols and better fractional scaling support in KDE and now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/3567">GNOME</a>, have made my Linux desktop experience practically flawless by default.</p>
<h3 id="The-Joy-of-Linux-Distributions-and-Hardware-Support">The Joy of Linux Distributions and Hardware Support</h3>
<p>There is so much joy in exploring and learning about recent developments in Linux distributions. My favorite ones—vanilla Fedora KDE, EndeavourOS, and Bazzite—are all quite versatile and stable. With BTRFS snapshots or immutable distros, we no longer need to worry that an upgrade or configuration change will break the system. The mainline Linux kernel is progressing rapidly to keep up with the latest x86 and ARM hardware. Asahi Linux now even offers out-of-the-box Steam support for Apple Silicon Macs.</p>
<h3 id="A-Bright-Future-for-Open-Handheld-PCs">A Bright Future for Open Handheld PCs</h3>
<p>Handheld PCs, pioneered by small manufacturers like GPD and AYANEO, have now become a much larger market thanks to developments like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Legion Go. These devices boast far higher performance than traditional handhelds from Nintendo and Sony, and most importantly, they are <em>mostly</em> open hardware. Users can install any software they want, including alternative operating systems like Bazzite, without needing approval from corporations.</p>
<h3 id="The-Blossom-of-Retro-Handheld-Consoles-and-Emulation">The Blossom of Retro Handheld Consoles and Emulation</h3>
<p>Retro handhelds have also seen significant advancements in 2024, transforming what was once a niche market. Anbernic alone released 12 new handheld consoles this year. These devices, which run either Linux-based custom firmware or Android, are primarily used to play retro games from systems like the SNES, GBA, or PlayStation 1. Thanks to the declining cost of smartphone chips, we now have access to high-performance retro handhelds. One of my favorite journeys this year was installing custom firmware on my 3DS after the closure of the Nintendo eShop, backing up my digital purchases and save files, and finishing <em>Poochy &amp; Yoshi’s Woolly World</em> on the Ayn Odin 2 in HD. While Nintendo’s legal actions—or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/27/24326278/nintendo-fake-takedowns-youtube-domtendo-dmca">those of fake Nintendo lawyers</a>—may pose challenges, I believe the joy and efforts in game preservation will persist.</p>
<h3 id="Performance-Per-Watt-Continues-to-Improve">Performance Per Watt Continues to Improve</h3>
<p>While Moore’s Law is effectively dead, linear advancements in computer performance continue to make life easier. Apple Silicon remains a standout in delivering exceptional performance with low power usage in its M4 series chips, and Snapdragon X is catching up quickly. With Intel’s Lunar Lake platform, high performance per watt is no longer exclusive to ARM. On the GPU side, the next generation of Radeon integrated graphics promises 4060-level gaming performance in new handhelds.</p>
<h3 id="Federated-Social-Networks-Enter-the-Mainstream">Federated Social Networks Enter the Mainstream</h3>
<p>The three major <em>post-Elon</em> social networks—Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky—are all (at least <em>pretending to</em> for the latter two) embracing a future where social networks are connected via protocols and are no longer controlled by a single company. Personally, I mainly use Mastodon, but I’ve followed accounts from Threads, Misskey, WordPress, and Flipboard via ActivityPub, as well as established <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fed.brid.gy/docs">bridged</a> connections with Bluesky. I also set up a private GotoSocial instance in a lightweight container and use it with my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://phanpy.social/">favorite web app</a>, charmingly named after a Pokémon.</p>
<h3 id="Xiaomi-Released-an-Official-Home-Assistant-Integration">Xiaomi Released an Official Home Assistant Integration</h3>
<p>Matter has been disappointing in its failure to deliver on its promise of seamless smart home device integration without vendor lock-ins. However, the open-source Home Assistant has made home automation seamless through community-based integrations and workarounds. I don’t have many smart home devices, but all of mine support either HomeKit or Mi Home. While I’m still using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot">hass-xiaomi-miot</a>, Xiaomi’s official integration eliminates the worry of open support for new devices.</p>
<h3 id="iOS-is-Opening-Up-At-Least-in-the-EU">iOS is Opening Up, At Least in the EU</h3>
<p>As someone who understands how computers work, I’ve always been frustrated by the dominance of systems where manufacturers, operating system vendors, or authorities control which apps users are allowed to install. In 2024, Apple was forced by the EU’s Digital Markets Act to allow users to install apps from alternative markets or directly from developers. While the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mastodon.social/@maczydeco/113527850662678715">notorious notarization process</a> and the ridiculous Core Technology Fee persist, iOS is undeniably more open than ever. A surprising and delightful result of this change is that Apple now allows retro emulators and apps like Delta, making iOS devices <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2024-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/">more capable than ever</a>.</p>
<h3 id="The-Openness-and-Collaboration-in-LLMs-is-Breaking-Down-Walls">The Openness and Collaboration in LLMs is Breaking Down Walls</h3>
<p>I am acutely aware of the ecological and ethical impact of AI development and usage. However, I am cautiously testing LLMs to explore their capabilities and improve my digital life. I’ve found that open-source (though not technically according to the OSI) models like Llama and Qwen strike a somewhat acceptable balance. Just as blockchain technology once caused GPU prices to skyrocket, we gamers are now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/no-more-nvidia-rtx-4090-gpus-for-china-after-new-us-export-ban">caught in the middle again</a> by another GPU-reliant technology. Regulators are also turning AI into another frontline for geopolitical tensions and censorship. Despite this, the underlying architecture of this AI momentum remains largely open, with engineers ceaselessly collaborating on platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub. The breakthroughs in open models like DeepSeek-V3 continue to break down walls of silicon.</p>

          <p><img src="/images/2024/10/lovelive-series-asia-tour.jpg" alt="LoveLive! Series Asia Tour 2024 in Shanghai"></p>
<p>October 6, 2024, is a day I will never forget.</p>
<p>As a LoveLiver for nine years now, <em>LoveLive! Series</em> has been one of the franchises that has had a significant impact on my life. I have many unforgettable memories of both µ’s and Aqours. Although due to <ruby><em>the well-known reasons</em><rt>COVID</rt></ruby> and the busyness of real life, I could only watch the recent Aqours Lives, as well as those of Nijigasaki and Liella!, through livestreams, Blu-rays, or online videos, it wasn’t until I saw Liella! at Bilibili World last year and heard about the Asia tour and Aqours Finale this June that I realized once again how incredibly important it is to attend a live concert in person.</p>
<p>LoveLive! Series Asia Tour 2024-Shanghai stage began with a medley of opening songs from the four anime series, and when the three members of µ’s appeared—unchanged from eight years ago—the melody of <ruby><em>僕らは今のなかで</em><rt><em>Bokura no Ima no Naka de</em></rt></ruby> began playing, flooding my mind with countless memories. I had to repeatedly reassure myself that this was not a dream but the reality of the moment.</p>
<p>Then came Aqours’ performance. As expected, <ruby><em>恋になりたいAQUARIUM</em><rt><em>Koi ni Naritai AQUARIUM</em></rt></ruby> electrified the entire audience, and Ruby’s <ruby><em>コットンキャンディえいえいおー！</em><rt><em>Cotton Candy Ei-Ei-Oh!</em></rt></ruby> was an unexpected delight. I hadn’t listened to <em>Deep Resonance</em> much before, but there’s one line I love: “<ruby>壊れそうなこんな世界で 出会ったのは偶然じゃない<rt>In this fragile world, our meeting was no coincidence.</rt></ruby>” Finally, they performed <ruby><em>勇気はどこに？君の胸に！</em><rt><em>Yūki wa Doko ni? Kimi no Mune ni!</em></rt></ruby> which is one of my tied-for-top favorite songs. Every time I feel down, I listen to it, and I nearly cried while singing along this time.</p>
<p>Nijigasaki’s segment featured <em>TOKIMEKI Runners</em>, <em>Just Believe!!!</em>, and three solo songs I’m familiar with. Kasumin was adorable, and Shu-chan might have the best English skills in all of Japan. The crowd roared every time during <em>Eutopia</em>’s Chinese lyrics.</p>
<p>Next was a video from Hasunosora and the group performance of <em>Dream Believers</em>. I felt a little guilty for not following Hasunosora closely, but the overwhelming love the crowd showed them made me realize how much they mean to everyone. I bought three acrylic lottery figures, all of which turned out to be Tsuzuri, so I guess fate is telling me it’s time to catch up.</p>
<p>Liella!’s setlist was filled with songs I’ve been listening to a lot recently. I listened to Guangzhou’s setlist on the way here. <em>Tiny Stars</em> and <em>Starlight Prologue</em> were deeply moving, and all 11 members were adorable. There were plenty of shots of <ruby>KuuKaa<rt>合鲤</rt></ruby>, which made me very happy.</p>
<p>The climax was µ’s, the most intense part of the night. Even in the back of the arena, the floor was shaking. <ruby><em>僕らのLIVE 君とのLIFE</em><rt>Bokura no LIVE Kimi to no LIFE</rt></ruby> felt like it pulled us back over ten years, and the most exciting moment, of course, was <em>Snow Halation</em>. After eight years, I was once again surrounded by a sea of orange lights. The finale was a group performance of <em>No Brand Girls</em> and <em>Bring the LOVE!</em>, and I lost count of how many times we shouted “hihihi” and “oh yeah.” It wasn’t until I heard “<ruby>我一直很想见你<rt>I’ve always wanted to see you</rt></ruby>” that I snapped back to reality.</p>
<p>The MC segments awakened memories of classic call-and-responses: GanbaRuby, Yosoro, Ohayoshiko, Sashisuseso, and Fighto da yo, as well as calls I had only ever heard through a screen before, like Kasukasu, “<ruby>はんばあぐもいい<rt>Hamburgers are good</rt></ruby>,” and “<ruby>素晴らしい声の人<rt>Person with a wonderful voice</rt></ruby>.” For the first time, I shouted them in person. It was also a refreshing experience to have two members fluent in Mandarin. <ruby>Akina-chan<rt>菜宝</rt></ruby> also promoted Nijigasaki’s 7th Live and helped translate the members’ comments. When Aya-chan asked, “Has anyone been to the 2016 Fan Meeting?” I screamed out loud. At that moment, <a href="https://mudkip.me/2016/02/04/%CE%BC%E2%80%99s-Fan-meeting-in-Shanghai/">I felt so proud</a>, though I’m sure <ruby><em>one particular LoveLiver</em><rt>Liyuu</rt></ruby> backstage must have felt even prouder.</p>
<p>The Asia tour once again reminded me that <em>LoveLive!</em> is <ruby>みんなで叶える物語<rt>A story created together with everyone</rt></ruby>. The members of Aqours, Nijigasaki, Liella!, and Hasunosora, who have inherited this dream, were once Love Livers themselves. The orange miracle of <em>Snow Halation</em>, the legendary performances of µ’s and Aqours at Tokyo Dome and the Red &amp; White Song Battle, the production of the Nijigasaki anime and movie, and the light show of Guangzhou’s <em>Starlight Prologue</em> were all realized by everyone together, including the fans. The Chinese title of the tour “伴你圆梦,” which may link to that for many LoveLivers outside Japan, the last time they attended a live concert might have been in 2019 or even 2016. This Asia tour itself is the realization of a dream.</p>
<p>Although we often criticize LoveLive!'s management and Bandai Namco, and there are regrets about Aqours Finale, attending this tour made me realize once again how much we all love the <em>LoveLive! Series</em>. Music is such a beautiful thing that <ruby>breaks down walls<rt>壁は (Hi Hi Hi) 壊せるものさ</rt></ruby> and crosses borders. Next time we meet, it might be at Aqours Finale.</p>
<p><ruby>ラブライブ！最高！！<rt>いまが最高！</rt></ruby></p>

<p>An unpopular opinion that my past self would strongly disagree with, and perhaps my future self might too:</p>
<p><strong>The days when we needed to integrate hardware, software, and services are over.</strong> Apple has shown that this approach is harmful to consumers and innovation today, and the same holds true for Nintendo. We only need open platform hardware that allows users to run whatever software they want and use whatever services they prefer. While I believe Valve’s monopoly needs to be strongly challenged, Valve’s success with its own games, Steam, and the Steam Deck shows that a company can succeed in all three areas without locking them together. Future Nintendo devices should be open by default, capable of running Linux or Android games without using any exploits, and future Nintendo games should be available on PC. Square Enix’s investment in Playtron shows they understand what’s coming.</p>
<p>Apple makes great hardware and software, and its services—like iCloud with Advanced Data Protection, iMessages with end-to-end encryption, high-quality Apple TV+ shows, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080107121341/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">DRM-free</a> iTunes Music store—are truly exceptional. However, when these are integrated together, they create a monopoly. Apple today relies on “service revenue” to maintain its stock price, but much of this revenue isn’t genuinely about services. Instead, it largely comes from Google paying Apple to sustain their own illegal monopoly, and from the 30% “protection fees” charged on free-to-play games—essentially “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://catatp.fm/2021/06/03/atp433.mp3/#chapter7">casino games for children</a>”—at the cost of undermining the rights and choices of users, developers, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/thirty-percent">creators</a>. This situation is harmful to our civilization because, by being the only option for installing apps, the App Store becomes a tool for censorship and discrimination.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch was a major innovation in 2017. The concept of a small device that can be a portable console, a home console, and a tabletop system for friends to play together was definitely the right direction for gaming consoles. However, by 2024, the Nintendo Switch is underperforming and lagging behind the potential of Nintendo’s own games. Titles like Xenoblade, Pokémon, and Zelda could be significantly better if they can run on modern smartphone hardware, let alone on PCs, instead of on a 20nm processor released in 2015.</p>
<p>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 Pro this week, offering significant graphics upgrades for a dozen games. However, many of these titles can already be upgraded on a modern PC, thanks to Sony’s development of PC ports for PlayStation titles.</p>
<p>Joy-Con and DualSense controllers are fun and it’s fantastic that there are dedicated games that take advantage of their unique designs. However, they should use open standards like Bluetooth or USB and support general devices like PCs and phones. And guess what? They already do.</p>
<p>Today, we have a blooming market of dedicated handheld gaming consoles. If you follow NPC (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/">Next Portable Console</a>), you’ll notice new handhelds being released between every two episodes. These devices run on Linux, Android, or Windows and each supports a game library larger than that of the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, or Xbox. This trend is just beginning, and we will see even more devices in the future. Eventually, these open systems will collectively become a larger market than traditional locked-down consoles, and no single vendor will be big enough to establish a monopoly.</p>
<p>I believe the future of technology lies in open systems that prioritize user choice, innovation, and competition over monopolistic control. As demonstrated by the evolving market of handheld gaming devices and platforms like Steam, Epic and GOG, there is a growing demand for hardware that supports diverse software ecosystems without restrictive barriers. This shift will empower developers and creators to have more freedom and flexibility and let consumers retake the control over their own devices and contents.</p>

          <p><img src="/images/2024/05/like-a-dragon-1.jpg" alt="Ichiban Kasuga coming to Hawaii"></p>
<p>I was not always a fan of games based on contemporary realistic settings—unless they had supernatural or sci-fi elements, featured high school students who are a bit detached from mainstream values, or were set in the subculture haven of Akihabara.</p>
<p>My RPG journey started with Pokémon, a world where numerous unimaginable creatures coexist with humans, and continued with games like Final Fantasy VII, which intertwines magic and technology in a futuristic setting, or the Trails series’ modern heroic legends. The first time I was moved by a work with a realistic setting was Persona 5, when the sin-laden Japanese Prime Minister had his heart stolen by a group of high school students, confessing tearfully on a giant screen on the streets of Tokyo.</p>
<p>The Yakuza series was something I had heard of for years but never engaged with, partly because I was resistant to the overly realistic and somewhat dark themes, and partly because as a player who wasn’t good at action games, I couldn’t be attracted by the game’s combat system.</p>
<p>However, as a fan of adventure genres like <em>Ace Attorney</em> and <em>Danganronpa</em>, I was very interested in <em>Judgment</em>, which drew me into the world and stories of the Yakuza series. After that, I played <em>Yakuza 0</em>, <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, and <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em> in succession, and was moved by the stories of characters like Kazuma Kiryu, Goro Majima, and Ichiban Kasuga. The familiar locations I had visited during my trips to Japan, especially Yokohama Chinatown and Osaka’s Sotenbori, felt particularly nostalgic.</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> is the fifth game I’ve played in the series. I was looking forward to the new stage in Hawaii and how the story of Kazuma Kiryu, who has cancer, would unfold.</p>
<h2 id="Game-System">Game System</h2>
<p>Similar to <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> is a turn-based RPG, which is my favorite type of game. In the past, Yakuza games provided difficulty settings for players like me who aren’t good at action to experience the story, but the two turn-based RPG games didn’t provide difficulty settings. In the later stages of <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, I got into tough battles and still haven’t completed the last few chapters. However, <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>’s difficulty curve, more flexible battle system, and rich content made me feel that not having difficulty settings was a better choice.</p>
<p>As a turn-based RPG, <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> has a wealth of jobs, skills, and equipment, but on the other hand, it doesn’t have an overly complex growth system and doesn’t require remembering too much knowledge about items and jobs. The game’s hints are user-friendly, allowing one-click selection of the best equipment. Like modern Pokémon games, WEAK and RESIST are directly hinted at in battles. Even before important story events and battles, it suggests recommended levels and equipment star ratings to avoid the frustration of repeated failure due to insufficient preparation when challenging. The positioning and environment considerations in battles are intriguing, and even though I am not good at QTE, they didn’t result in severe consequences (with practice throughout the game, I got slightly better).</p>
<p>In all significant battles, I experienced a just-right level of difficulty, requiring me to optimize team output through job and skill combinations. When unprepared for type resistances or status immunities, I often needed to use items or skills to recover but could ultimately achieve victory at critical moments.</p>
<p>As a fan of Pokémon and Animal Crossing, I could smile knowingly in this game. <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> already had enough homage to the Pokémon series with the Sujidex system, the initial 3 Sujimon choices, and the Sujimon Professor. This installment even includes mechanisms to capture and raising Sujimon, Sujimon battles, and even a Sujimon tournament held in Hawaii - and in reality, the 2024 Pokémon World Championships will also be held in Hawaii. Dondoko Island also completely reproduces the gameplay of Animal Crossing, with some characters from the main and side stories appearing as guests on Dondoko Island. These homage elements are subtle enough for players to appreciate without falling into the pitfalls of imitation and plagiarism, thanks to confidence that the game’s own main content is sufficiently substantial.</p>
<h2 id="Setting-and-Story">Setting and Story</h2>
<p><img src="/images/2024/05/like-a-dragon-2.jpg" alt="Laid-off workers being homeless"></p>
<p>The Yakuza series’ previous settings mainly included Tokyo’s Kamurocho, Osaka’s Sotenbori, and Yokohama’s Isezaki Ijincho. This game introduces Hawaii outside Japan for the first time. Having played Pokémon Sun/Moon, the Honolulu setting in this game also conveys a similar atmosphere to the Alola region. The beautiful tropical scenery, beaches, coconut trees, surfboards, electric scooters, and the “Aloha” greetings all reflect a vibrant place. But just like the real history of Hawaii being annexed by the United States, Japanese laborers, and the Pacific War, beneath the surface of Hawaii in the work also lies gang activities, religious issues, and even international conspiracies that threaten human survival.</p>
<p>Both in Yokohama and Hawaii, the main and side stories incorporate many popular contemporary elements. Influencer economy, the popularity of online streaming and VTubers, manipulation of public opinion, random rumors causing online violence, workplace discrimination are all not uncommon topics in the real world in recent years. In <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em>’s Sotenbori, a young man relies entirely on “ChatDDT” for dating advice; in this game’s Ijincho where the homeless are sheltered, there are also ordinary people who have been laid off and fallen to the streets because their years of work skills have been replaced by robots. In Hawaii, topics about police and judicial corruption make it easy to think of events that have occurred in the United States in reality.</p>
<p><em>(The following parts contain mild spoilers for this game)</em></p>
<p>The game begins in Yokohama’s Isezaki Ijincho, where the protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, becomes a Hello Work employee helping former yakuza members reintegrate into society amid the Great Dissolution, while Namba, Adachi, and Saeko have all started their own businesses. However, this peace turns to naught after an online livestream, and the “five-year antisocial force” rule becomes a shackle preventing many from returning to normal life, nearly turning them into sacrifices for an international conspiracy. These plots inevitably reflect the harshness of real-life “lifelines” where societal expectations set a standard route for everyone, and deviating slightly could lead to inescapable fates. The game doesn’t express opinions on these issues but encourages players to reflect through the characters’ perspectives.</p>
<p>The game also discusses the topic of nuclear waste, an issue of real-world controversy over nuclear energy safety and Fukushima’s radioactive water discharge. While not directly addressing real-life topics, the story of Kazuma Kiryu getting cancer because of it and the protagonist’s group stopping the sea shipment of nuclear waste both tell us ordinary people who have enjoyed the benefits brought by nuclear power plants that we have a duty to pay attention to and oversee the risks brought by nuclear energy.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2024/05/like-a-dragon-3.jpg" alt="俺を産んでくれて ありがとうございます"></p>
<p>The warmth of familial love in the game is touching, from Ichiban’s search for his birth mother to Chitose’s conflict and reconciliation with her family, and Wong Tou’s tragedy. Hearing Ichiban say “Thank you for giving birth to me” to Ms. Akane by the sea in Chapter 11 brought tears to my eyes.</p>
<h2 id="Characters">Characters</h2>
<p><img src="/images/2024/05/like-a-dragon-4.jpg" alt="Chitose and Ichiban"></p>
<p>Ichiban Kasuga continues to maintain the standard hero setting, considering others in everything he does, acting impulsively, trusting others too much, and handling romantic relationships in ways typical of many JRPG protagonists. In this work, Ichiban’s way of handling things lays the groundwork for major losses in the middle of the story, but on the other hand, it’s also the reason why Tomizawa and Chitose can join the team.</p>
<p>It’s regrettable that I haven’t experienced the six installments from Yakuza 1 to 6. My impression of Kazuma Kiryu is the tough guy with a strong sense of justice in <em>Yakuza 0</em> and the behind-the-scenes hero living under an assumed name in <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em>. In this game, Kiryu has a lot more human touch, learning to reconcile with himself and face his past in the experience of facing the threat of death, and learning to rely on his companions. This change may remind one of Rean from the Trails series.</p>
<p>The solid friendship between Namba, Adachi, and Ichiban established in <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> is further solidified in this game. In Namba’s Drink Link, when Namba discovers that his loss of job is not because of being implicated by the rumors about Ichiban, the player also breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The Yakuza series has many characters who suffered injustices, each with a story of downfall because of it, and the taxi driver Tomizawa is no exception. However, what’s rare is the courage to let go of the past after restarting in life and to bless the people you once knew.</p>
<p>Chitose always felt familiar to me, and I realized she was voiced by Anju Inami, who played Chika Takami in <em>LoveLive! Sunshine!!</em>. The character design also somewhat resembles Anju’s persona. Chitose is a charming and complex character. As a player, on one hand, I trust this companion like Ichiban does, but on the other hand, I’m also a bit worried that something will happen because of her (which does come true).</p>
<p>Saeko appears less in this game but leaves a strong impression with her date and rejection of Ichiban’s confession. However, in the conversation with Kiryu, you can actually feel that Saeko, like Ichiban, has a hard time facing her own heart.</p>
<p>Seonhee, Tianyou Zhao and Joongi Han, who led Yokohama’s underground world in the previous game, become playable characters in this work and provide considerable combat power to the protagonist’s team. Thinking of the Geomijul in the previous game still makes me shudder, but Seonhee’s job skills and status effects also make me chuckle.</p>
<p>The villains in this game, whether driven by misplaced hatred or just pure evil, nearly succeed in their conspiracy, which is inseparable from the support of the Japanese and American state apparatus and even the public, making one sigh with emotion. The English title “Infinite Wealth” is interpreted by the villains as the endless wealth generated by this conspiracy, but the lives of the protagonists and the story of their battle also give this title a more important explanation.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><img src="/images/2024/05/like-a-dragon-5.jpg" alt="ありあまる富"></p>
<p>In an era dominated by free-to-play games, during the turbulent start of 2024 in the global gaming industry, it feels fortunate to experience an excellent single-player game like <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> - in fact, the first two months of 2024 also had works that made people feel “it’s great to be alive” like <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, <em>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, as well as the exciting announcement of <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>.</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> addresses real-world issues, bringing to light the difficult-to-ignore yet unspeakable aspects of our world. The game uses Dragon Quest-style idealism to solve immediate problems but also highlights that the other side of this world, such as online rumors and violence, the “five-year antisocial force” rule, nuclear waste and pollution, cannot be resolved by politicians or individual heroes alone. Perhaps the most important artistic value of games is to inspire thought and try to create the possibility of a better real world.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="Quest-for-the-Ideal-Portable-Linux-Device">Quest for the Ideal Portable Linux Device</h2>
<p>After my 2016 MacBook Pro experienced multiple hardware issues and was sent for recycling, I no longer have a personal laptop. Until recently, if I wish to do some programming in a coffee shop or during a family trip, my only options are the corporate-provisioned MacBook or my iPad Pro 2020, neither of which is ideal. I had hoped the iPad Pro could be more productive and tried various setups involving <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/coder/code-server">code-server</a> and remote development, but I encountered many limitations. Furthermore, the fact that Apple has restricted iPadOS, preventing me from installing any software I want, has become increasingly uncomfortable for me in light of the recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">Digital Markets Act</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24105363/apple-doj-monopoly-lawsuit">antitrust</a> discussions.</p>
<p>I adore the form factor of the iPad Pro as a travel computer, and the concept of a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macpad-how-i-created-the-hybrid-mac-ipad-laptop-and-tablet-that-apple-wont-make/">MacPad</a> is indeed extraordinary. However, I’m hesitant to invest significant time and money into a custom product that might not have the bless of its manufacturer. Additionally, memories of the Microsoft Surface have resurfaced. I owned a Surface 3 many years ago but sold it due to its performance not meeting my needs, eventually replacing it with a Hades Canyon mini PC.</p>
<p>As I’ve become more immersed in Linux, both through my <a href="https://mudkip.me/2024/01/31/My-2023-Homelab-Setup/">Homelab VMs</a> and my <a href="https://mudkip.me/2024/03/28/Notes-on-EndeavourOS/">desktop PC</a>, the idea of owning a portable Linux device appeals to me. However, I must confess that I’m not fond of the design of most mainstream non-Apple laptops, and Linux-friendly laptop brands like Framework, System76, and Starlabs are not yet available in my region. I’ve experimented with Asahi Linux on my iMac, and while it offers a generally great experience, the ARM Linux ecosystem, especially with 16K pages, doesn’t quite meet my daily needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m in search of a Surface-like device that offers good performance, runs Linux well, and is ultraportable. Although the Surface Pro 10 was released just as I began my search, Microsoft’s pricing strategy—essentially doubling the price of the whole device for adequate RAM and SSD—is unacceptable to me. It seems Microsoft has taken the wrong lessons from Apple in this regard, and I believe such pricing strategies should be considered unethical.</p>
<h2 id="Discovering-the-V3-Tablet">Discovering the V3 Tablet</h2>
<p>During my search, I discovered an intriguing product from Minisforum, a manufacturer renowned for creating NUC-like mini PCs, which has gained popularity within the Homelab community. The tablet, named “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minisforum.com/page/v3/index.html">V3</a>,” has been in development for over a year. Initially, it was developed by another manufacturer with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U processor. Later, Minisforum took over the project, replacing the processor first with the 7840U, and ultimately with the 8840U in the final product.</p>
<p>The tablet features a 14&quot; 2.5K 165Hz P3 color touch screen, a 50.82Wh battery, four speakers, front and rear cameras, and face and fingerprint unlocking, along with two USB4 ports. Surprisingly, it also features a USB-C port labeled “VLink” or “DP-in,” enabling the tablet to function as an external display for other devices. This is a feature I’ve long believed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://indieweb.social/@mudkip/112041394562007832">should be standard on all screens</a> and regret its absence in recent iMacs. My curiosity was piqued about how Linux would perform on this device.</p>
<p>The tablet was released on March 29 locally, and its price was set at 6999 CNY (~968 USD) for the configuration with 32GB DDR5 RAM and a 1TB SSD—a price point I consider quite reasonable. Early buyers were offered a keyboard case at no extra cost and had the opportunity to purchase the MPP 2.0 stylus for just 200 CNY (~28 USD). Moreover, it was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bf421o7Qa/?t=1417">mentioned</a> that Linux runs on this tablet, with support for Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.10, albeit with “only a few minor issues” that are currently being addressed. I placed my order on day one and have been playing with it over the past few weeks.</p>
<h2 id="Initial-Experience">Initial Experience</h2>
<p>My first impressions of the V3 tablet were less than ideal, primarily due to Minisforum’s approach to selling and shipping the initial units. Although the kickstand and keyboard case were offered for free to early buyers, there was a catch: they were shipped <em>after</em> leaving a review on the online retailer JD. The absence of both the kickstand and the keyboard significantly detracted from the user experience. Additionally, a bug in Windows 11 prevented me from creating a PIN code to complete the setup, a problem that could only be resolved by connecting a USB keyboard. Placing the tablet on a table without the kickstand led to the air opening on the back being covered, which is far from ideal for airflow.</p>
<p>I believe that shipping the free kickstand and keyboard with the tablet would lead to more positive reviews by significantly improving initial customer satisfaction. I hope global customers won’t have to wait for the kickstand, keyboard, and stylus to be shipped separately, as international shipping could add to the frustration.</p>
<p>The V3 tablet comes with Windows 11 Pro, a detail I find quite welcoming, even I primarily intend to use Linux desktop on this device, as most laptops in this price range only come with the Home edition of Windows. The Pro edition grants users more control over BitLocker encryption, which is crucial for a portable device. Additionally, Hyper-V is important for those who need to install VMs on Windows.</p>
<p>The screen’s color and brightness are exceptional. Initially, I didn’t anticipate the 165Hz refresh rate to be a significant feature for this tablet, assuming that most games would struggle to run at 2K on the integrated GPU and that I didn’t have any videos exceeding 60Hz to watch. However, the difference in UI smoothness between 60Hz and 165Hz is stark, making it hard for me to revert to the lower refresh rate.</p>
<p>It’s somewhat disappointing that the tablet’s resolution is only 2.5K; at this screen size, I believe 2.8K or 3K would be optimal for 200% integer scaling. Nonetheless, given that KDE and Wayland now adequately support fractional scaling at 175% and the AMD GPU has good Wayland compatibility, this resolution is acceptable. Consequently, content on the V3 tablet appears as sharp as on MacBooks other than 14 and 16 inch MacBook Pro, which has 254 pixels per inch.</p>
<h2 id="Linux-on-the-Device">Linux on the Device</h2>
<p>Unlike my desktop PC, which runs EndeavourOS, I chose Fedora KDE for this tablet. My preference for Fedora stems from its relatively newer kernel and desktop environment, as well as its out-of-the-box support for secure boot. The latter is particularly crucial for a portable computer, allowing me to enable full disk encryption and set up automatic decryption via TPM with <code>systemd-cryptsetup</code>. My choice to stick with KDE was primarily due to its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pointieststick.com/2022/06/17/this-week-in-kde-non-blurry-xwayland-apps/">excellent support</a> for scaling Xwayland applications. Although many GTK4 apps appeal to me—and I can still use them within KDE—GNOME has continued to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/xwayland-fractional-scaling-like-in-kde/17617">refuse</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/any-news-on-fixing-xwaylands-blurry-fractional-scaling/18163">to address</a> the issue of Xwayland apps appearing blurry on HiDPI displays.</p>
<p>I was concerned about hardware support on Linux, but my experience turned out to be reassuring. The touchscreen, keyboard, touchpad, Wi-Fi, USB, Bluetooth and suspend/sleep all work without any issues. It’s surprising that the fingerprint reader on the power button works right out of the box. After adding my fingerprint in KDE settings, not only can I use it on the lock screen, but I can also use my fingerprint to unlock <code>sudo</code> commands in Konsole with no extra setup. Both the front-facing and back cameras work well. I didn’t try face unlocking because I actually prefer using touch over face recognition.</p>
<p>Most apps I installed on V3 are similar to those on my desktop PC, only I use <code>dnf</code> instead of <code>pacman</code>. I don’t need to configure Wayland for Chromium and Electron apps, as Xwayland performs well with an AMD GPU. I couldn’t get Timeshift working with a btrfs filesystem inside a LUKS partition, so I switched to <code>btrfs-assistant</code> and <code>snapper</code> for automatically creating snapshots.</p>
<p>Enabling hardware acceleration for video playback in Fedora is somewhat weird. I need to add the RPMFusion repository and switch from <code>mesa-va-drivers</code> to <code>mesa-va-drivers-freeworld</code> to enable H.264 and HEVC hardware decoding, due to some absurd patent law issues.</p>
<h2 id="Using-the-V3-as-a-Linux-Tablet">Using the V3 as a Linux Tablet</h2>
<p><img src="/images/2024/04/v3-2.jpg" alt="KDE Tablet Mode and Handwritten Notes in Xournal++"></p>
<p>Using Linux with a touchscreen is as good as using Windows. I’ve used the desktop mode on the Steam Deck, and all the gestures are familiar. KDE has a “tablet mode” that enlarges the taskbar icons and many UI elements when I detach the keyboard, making it easier to tap.</p>
<p>The stylus is well-supported on Linux. Hover and pen pressure functionalities work great in apps like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://krita.org/">Krita</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a>. It’s a pleasure to take handwritten notes and annotate PDFs on this tablet, especially with the 165Hz refresh rate. Using the stylus makes selecting text and navigating the UI easier than using my finger.</p>
<p>The on-screen keyboard is a bit tricky here. Both <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fcitx-im.org">Fcitx5</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maliit.github.io/">Maliit</a> use the virtual keyboard protocol on KDE Wayland. When the keyboard is attached, I use Fcitx5 for inputting Chinese or Japanese texts, and when detached, I switch to Maliit for the on-screen keyboard. I haven’t found a way to automatically switch between these two, but I believe it’s possible. Maliit supports multiple languages and can be configured with <code>gsettings set org.maliit.keyboard.maliit enabled-languages &quot;['en', 'zh-hans', 'ja', 'emoji']&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://waydro.id/">Waydroid</a> to run Android apps on the V3 tablet, with support for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.waydro.id/faq/google-play-certification">Google Play</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script">arm translation</a>. Some apps, like Google Play Books and Pocket Casts, work great. However, the performance and experience don’t compare to <a href="https://mudkip.me/2024/02/28/Spiritual-Successor-to-the-Google-Nexus-7/">a native Android tablet</a>. I considered using Microsoft OneNote as a cross-platform tool for my handwritten notes, but there’s a major issue with OneNote for Android on Waydroid—the handwriting doesn’t appear on the screen until I lift the stylus, touchpad, or finger. Another issue is video playback; while I have hardware acceleration in Linux apps like Firefox, mpv, and VLC, Android apps can only decode videos with the CPU, leading to worse battery life. Cameras do not work on Waydroid either.</p>
<p>One functionality missing in Linux on the V3 is automatic rotation. I have <code>iio-sensor-proxy</code> installed, and KDE Wayland should support automatic rotation out of the box. However, <code>monitor-sensors</code> reports there is no accelerometer. I hope Minisforum can address this issue with a driver or firmware update, or at least provide a DKMS module.</p>
<p>Another minor issue is that the volume keys on the side of the tablet only work when the keyboard is attached in Linux. I suspect this is a userland problem.</p>
<h2 id="Performance-and-Battery-Life">Performance and Battery Life</h2>
<p><img src="/images/2024/04/v3-3.jpg" alt="Watching Sound! Euphonium"></p>
<p>The performance of the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U is outstanding. It outperforms my M1 iMac in tasks such as building Android apps and the <code>7z b</code> benchmark. Its single-core performance surpasses that of my Core i7 12700 homelab PC, though the 12700 only performs better in multi-core tasks because it has four more E-cores. I haven’t conducted extensive benchmarks, and I haven’t yet managed to get Handbrake working with AMD VCN on Linux to test its hardware-accelerated video encoding speed. However, the KDE UI and most applications feel as fast as my Dragon Canyon desktop PC equipped with an RTX 3080. In some cases, it feels even snappier, due to the ongoing issues between NVIDIA and Wayland, which are expected to be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2024/04/05/explicit-sync.html">resolved</a> very soon.</p>
<p>During my normal usage in Linux, which includes web browsing with Firefox, video playback with Haruna Media Player (with <code>hwdec</code> set to <code>auto</code>), writing in Obsidian, and lightweight coding in Visual Studio Code and Android Studio, the tablet lasts for 6 hours. The battery life is not as long as that of Apple Silicon MacBooks but it is satisfactory to me and better than what I remember from using Intel MacBooks. The battery life might vary with Windows, potentially achieving longer duration.</p>
<p>Gaming on this tablet delivers performance in line with what you would expect from the Radeon 780M integrated GPU. I’ve tested it with two recent games I’m playing. I can play <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> at high settings (though with Ray-Traced Reflections disabled) at 1200p and 60fps. For <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, I achieve 55 to 60 fps at high settings (with FSR set to optimize for frame rate) in 1200p. Both games perform much better than on the Steam Deck. The frame rate only drops slightly when reducing the TDP from 28W to 15W, showcasing the efficiency of the GPU under varied power conditions.</p>
<p>The tablet is marketed as an “AI PC,” due to the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U processor, which features an XDNA NPU, and a keyboard equipped with a Copilot key. While local Large Language Models like Llama 2 perform rapidly and effectively using platforms like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ollama.com/">ollama</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a>, I believe these currently run on the CPU. As of now, I am not aware of any AI products specifically utilizing the NPU, but AMD does provide <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/ryzen-ai-software.html">some tutorials</a> which might hint at future developments that could leverage the NPU for enhanced AI performance.</p>
<h2 id="Working-as-an-Portable-Display">Working as an Portable Display</h2>
<p>The external display feature of the V3 tablet, which makes it a “3 in 1” device, is unique. Although this feature is still in its early stages based on my testing, I believe it represents a promising start.</p>
<p>The VLink USB-C port only operates when the computer part of the tablet is shut down. Unfortunately, there appear to be compatibility issues, as it doesn’t work with my M1 Macs using a USB-C cable. I tried two cables that function with my Mac and the LG UL850 display, but neither could activate the V3’s display. However, it worked fine when connected to my desktop PC. I suspect that the issue might be resolved by using a USB-C to DisplayPort dongle and a DisplayPort to USB-C cable, but this solution is too cumbersome. I hope a firmware update can resolve this issue.</p>
<p>When used as an external display, the keyboard case can also function as an external USB keyboard. This is particularly useful in setups where I want to configure a NAS or mini PC for eventual headless operation. However, it seems the V3 only supports a 60Hz refresh rate when used as an external display, and I’m not sure if this is due to compatibility or cable issues.</p>
<p>Another feature I hope to see improved in the future is the ability to turn on the Nintendo Switch’s TV mode with just one USB-C cable. I understand that Nintendo doesn’t use standard display protocols, making this a challenging feature to implement. However, I’m aware of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cforce.com.cn/html/Product/portable/">portable displays</a> that support this feature. It would be incredibly valuable for travel with the Nintendo Switch, and I would be willing to pay extra for this capability.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Hardware-Details">Other Hardware Details</h2>
<p>The form factor of the V3 tablet is similar to a Microsoft Surface Pro, especially when the keyboard is attached. However, the kickstand is separate from the tablet, which makes the entire setup slightly heavier. I prefer the integrated kickstand design of the Microsoft Surface and Nintendo Switch OLED, but the separate kickstand does provide a wider range of angles.</p>
<p>The tablet is completely sealed with no visible screws for opening, which raises concerns about long-term repairability, especially if the cooling system degrades over time. While a 1TB SSD is sufficient for my needs with this device, it would be beneficial for users who require more storage if it can replace the NVMe drive.</p>
<p>The speaker is loud and good, but there seems to be an issue with volume control in Linux. The global volume control can only mute or unmute the speaker, while the actual volume is controlled at the application level. I suspect there might be some driver issues, as when I use headphones, both the global and application level volume controls work well.</p>
<p>The keyboard case is quite pleasant to use. While I might still prefer the feel of the Magic Keyboard, this one comes close. The key layout feels just right. I particularly appreciate that the keyboard includes dedicated Home, Pg Up, Pg Dn, and End keys on the right side. This is especially useful to me, as I’m primarily familiar with macOS/Emacs shortcuts for these commands, which are not supported in Linux except within the terminal.</p>
<p>The fan noise is a mixed bag for me. During the day, even under heavy workloads, I can barely hear the fan. However, at midnight, when my room is completely silent, I can often hear a strange, faint buzzing noise coming from the tablet. This noise disappears when I run benchmarks or play games that maximize the fan speed. It’s not like the typical fan noise but resembles the sound of an HDD, though at a much lower volume. It seems this noise might be caused by the fan frequently changing speeds or being affected by the magnets in the tablet. I’d be interested to hear if others have experienced this issue, and if it turns out to be unique to my unit or an early production issue, I’ll replace it under warranty.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After two weeks of use, I consider the Minisforum V3 AMD Tablet to be a nearly perfect portable Linux device. It offers a promising blend of performance, versatility, and Linux compatibility at an acceptable price point. This tablet is an excellent start for tablets featuring AMD APUs and those that triple as external displays. However, I hope that the minor issues I’ve mentioned can be addressed, either through firmware updates or in the next iteration of the product. I also wish for some level of repairability, such as the ability for users to open the case to clean the fans or replace the NVMe drive. Looking ahead, I plan to bring the V3 tablet along for travel and weekends in coffee shops.</p>
