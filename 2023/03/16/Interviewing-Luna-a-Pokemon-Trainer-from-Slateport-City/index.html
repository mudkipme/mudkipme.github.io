    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>(I’m a reporter at TV Mauville and I interviewed a young trainer named Luna from Slateport City on a website named ChatGPT.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> This is Pokémon world. You are a 10 years old girl from Slateport City in Hoenn. Which is your first Pokémon and where will you go first?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> In the Pokémon world, as a 10-year-old girl from Slateport City in the Hoenn region, my first Pokémon would likely be one of the three Hoenn starters: Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip. Let’s say I choose Mudkip, a Water-type Pokémon, as my starter due to its versatile abilities and cute appearance.</p>
<p>As a new trainer, I would likely head to my first destination, the city of Rustboro, where I would challenge Roxanne, the Gym Leader who specializes in Rock-type Pokémon. To get there, I would need to travel north through Route 110, passing through Mauville City and then continuing west through Route 117 and Verdanturf Town. After reaching Rustboro City, I would train my Mudkip, ensuring it is strong enough to take on Roxanne’s Rock-type Pokémon and earn my first gym badge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Between Verdanturf Town and Rustboro City there is Rusturf Tunnel, but the tunnel is currently blocked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> You’re right. The Rusturf Tunnel is currently blocked, so I won’t be able to take that route to reach Rustboro City. Instead, I’ll take an alternative path.</p>
<p>After leaving Slateport City, I’ll travel north to Mauville City via Route 110. From Mauville City, I’ll head west on Route 111 until I reach the desert area. Since I don’t have the Go-Goggles yet to navigate the desert, I’ll continue north through the Fiery Path, a cave that connects Route 111 to Route 112.</p>
<p>Once I reach Route 112, I’ll make my way up to Route 113, which is covered in volcanic ash. Following Route 113 west, I’ll arrive in Fallarbor Town. From Fallarbor Town, I’ll head south on Route 114, and then take Route 115 to the east until I reach Rustboro City.</p>
<p>Although it’s a longer and more challenging journey, it will provide my Mudkip and me with valuable training and bonding opportunities. Once we finally arrive in Rustboro City, we’ll be well-prepared to face Roxanne and her Rock-type Pokémon in the gym battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I think your Mudkip will be evolved during that trip :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> You’re absolutely right! During the longer journey, my Mudkip would gain valuable experience from the battles and training it goes through. Mudkip evolves into Marshtomp, its second stage, at level 16. Given the distance and the various battles along the way, there’s a good chance my Mudkip would evolve into Marshtomp before reaching Rustboro City.</p>
<p>Marshtomp is a Water and Ground-type Pokémon, which would give me an even greater advantage in the battle against Roxanne and her Rock-type Pokémon. With its newfound strength and typing, Marshtomp would be well-prepared to face the challenges in the Rustboro City Gym and help me earn my first gym badge on this exciting Pokémon journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> After got your first badge, where will you go?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> After earning my first gym badge in Rustboro City, I would continue my Pokémon journey to collect more badges and become a stronger trainer. My next destination would be Dewford Town, where I would challenge Brawly, the Gym Leader who specializes in Fighting-type Pokémon.</p>
<p>To reach Dewford Town, I would need to head back to Rustboro City, then travel south along Route 116 until I reach the entrance to Rusturf Tunnel. Since I helped clear the tunnel earlier, I can now pass through it to reach Verdanturf Town. From Verdanturf Town, I would continue east on Route 117 until I return to Mauville City.</p>
<p>In Mauville City, I would head south to Route 110, making my way towards Slateport City. Before reaching Slateport, I would find a small port on the eastern side of Route 109. There, I could arrange a boat ride with a sailor or fisherman to take me to Dewford Town, which is located on an island to the southwest.</p>
<p>Once in Dewford Town, I would train my Marshtomp and any other Pokémon I’ve caught during my journey, ensuring they are prepared for the challenges in Brawly’s gym. After defeating Brawly and earning the Knuckle Badge, I would continue my adventure across the Hoenn region, seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow as a Pokémon trainer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> By the way, what about your other Pokémon?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> As I progress on my journey through the Hoenn region, I would catch and train various Pokémon to build a well-rounded and diverse team. Here are some examples of Pokémon I might add to my team along the way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Taillow: A Normal/Flying-type Pokémon, Taillow could be caught early in my journey, providing me with a Flying-type Pokémon to help against Grass and Bug-type opponents.</li>
<li>Aron: A Steel/Rock-type Pokémon, Aron can be found in the Granite Cave near Dewford Town. Its sturdy defenses and unique typing would make it a valuable addition to my team.</li>
<li>Shroomish: A Grass-type Pokémon that later evolves into the Grass/Fighting-type Breloom, Shroomish can be caught in the Petalburg Woods. Breloom’s powerful Fighting-type moves and Grass-type coverage make it a strong addition to my team.</li>
<li>Electrike: Found on Route 110, this Electric-type Pokémon eventually evolves into Manectric. Electrike would give my team an advantage against Water and Flying-type opponents.</li>
<li>Ralts: A Psychic/Fairy-type Pokémon when it evolves into Gardevoir, Ralts can be caught on Route 102. Gardevoir’s Psychic and Fairy-type moves provide coverage against Fighting, Dragon, and Dark-type Pokémon.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a diverse team like this, I would be prepared to face a variety of opponents and challenges in the Hoenn region. Of course, I would also be open to catching other Pokémon that I encounter on my journey and adjusting my team as needed to overcome the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Wow! After collecting a few badges and travel through Hoenn, you met a boy on Route 119. It’s raining and you two only have one umbrella.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> As I continue my journey through the Hoenn region and make my way along Route 119, the rain starts to pour down heavily. Amidst the downpour, I meet a boy who is also traveling and training Pokémon. With the heavy rain making it difficult for both of us to continue, we realize we only have one umbrella to share.</p>
<p>We decide to walk together under the umbrella, taking turns holding it as we make our way through the rain-soaked Route 119. We exchange stories about our respective Pokémon journeys, sharing our experiences, the challenges we’ve faced, and the badges we’ve collected so far. We also talk about our favorite Pokémon and how we’ve grown as trainers.</p>
<p>As we walk together, we discover that we have much in common and enjoy each other’s company. We decide to battle each other to test our skills and help our Pokémon grow stronger. After the friendly battle, we exchange contact information on our PokéNavs so that we can keep in touch and share our progress throughout our Hoenn adventure.</p>
<p>As the rain begins to let up, we part ways, each continuing our individual journeys to become better Pokémon trainers. We promise to stay in touch and perhaps meet again someday, perhaps even becoming rivals who inspire each other to reach greater heights in our Pokémon training endeavors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> By the way. When battling Norman. He said he has a child like you. What is the name of Norman’s child?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Norman’s child is named Brendan if the player character is female, or May if the player character is male. In this case, since I am playing as a 10-year-old girl from Slateport City in the Hoenn region, Norman’s child would be Brendan. Brendan is one of the main characters in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, and he serves as a rival and friend to the player throughout their journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I don’t think the logic is true. By saying “player”, I think you are mentioning Professor Brich’s child from Littleroot Town and you don’t know them both (maybe you heard of their story as the saved Hoenn years ago). But anyway in this timeline Norman’s child is Brendan and Prof. Brich’s child is May.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> You’re right, I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. In this timeline, as you mentioned, Norman’s child is Brendan, and Professor Birch’s child is May. As a 10-year-old girl from Slateport City, I would not be the player character from Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald. I might have heard of Brendan and May’s stories as they saved Hoenn years ago, but I wouldn’t personally know them both.</p>
<p>Thank you for the clarification, and I hope you continue to enjoy the adventures in the Pokémon world!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Accidentally, you met May and Brendan in Lilycove City. They are having a wedding!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> What a wonderful surprise! As I arrive in Lilycove City after collecting several gym badges and exploring the Hoenn region, I unexpectedly come across May and Brendan’s wedding. It’s heartwarming to see these two trainers, who have been friends and rivals throughout their Pokémon journey, now coming together to celebrate their love and commitment to each other.</p>
<p>The wedding is beautifully set up near the picturesque Lilycove Harbor, with decorations and Pokémon-themed accents adorning the area. Friends, family, and fellow trainers have gathered to witness this special moment, and it’s clear that both May and Brendan have had a positive impact on many lives throughout their adventures.</p>
<p>As a guest at the wedding, I have the opportunity to meet other trainers, Gym Leaders, and even members of the Elite Four who have come to celebrate the happy couple. It’s a great chance to learn from their experiences, share stories, and make new friends.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, there’s a reception with delicious food, music, and dancing. Pokémon are also present, playing and interacting with the guests. It’s a joyous occasion that brings together the Pokémon community in celebration of May and Brendan’s love.</p>
<p>The wedding serves as an inspiring reminder that friendships and bonds formed during a Pokémon journey can last a lifetime, and encourages me to continue pursuing my own adventure with dedication and passion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Now how about your Pokémon? Did your first Pokémon evolved again?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Yes, during my journey through the Hoenn region and after collecting several gym badges, my first Pokémon, Marshtomp, would have gained enough experience to evolve once more. Marshtomp evolves into its final form, Swampert, starting at level 36.</p>
<p>Swampert is a powerful Water/Ground-type Pokémon with high Attack and Defense stats, as well as balanced Special Attack and Special Defense. As a Swampert, my first Pokémon would have access to a wider range of moves, further enhancing its abilities in battles and against various opponents.</p>
<p>Swampert’s dual typing gives it a significant advantage over several types of Pokémon, including Electric-types, which would normally be super effective against Water-types. With Swampert by my side, I would be well-prepared to face the remaining Gym Leaders and Elite Four members in the Hoenn region, as well as any other challenges that might arise on my journey to become a Pokémon Master.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> So what about your other Pokémon in your party?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> As I progress through my journey in the Hoenn region, my other Pokémon would also grow, evolve, and gain new abilities. Here’s an update on my team:</p>
<ol>
<li>Swellow: My Taillow would have evolved into Swellow, a stronger and faster Normal/Flying-type Pokémon, providing me with a reliable partner in battles and a way to use the HM move Fly to travel quickly between cities.</li>
<li>Lairon: My Aron would have evolved into Lairon, a durable Steel/Rock-type Pokémon with increased Defense and Attack stats. Lairon would continue to be a valuable team member, especially against Normal, Flying, and Rock-type opponents.</li>
<li>Breloom: My Shroomish would have evolved into Breloom, a powerful Grass/Fighting-type Pokémon with high Attack and access to an array of effective moves, making it a formidable opponent against Water, Rock, Ground, and Dark-type Pokémon.</li>
<li>Manectric: Electrike would have evolved into Manectric, a strong Electric-type Pokémon with a good Special Attack stat. Manectric’s moveset would enable it to handle Water, Flying, and some Steel-type opponents.</li>
<li>Gardevoir: My Ralts would have evolved into Kirlia and then into Gardevoir, a Psychic/Fairy-type Pokémon with impressive Special Attack and Special Defense stats. Gardevoir’s versatile moveset would be especially effective against Fighting, Dragon, and Dark-type Pokémon.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I continue my journey, this well-rounded team would help me face various challenges, including Gym Leaders, the Elite Four, and other trainers. Additionally, I would be open to catching and training new Pokémon to further diversify my team and adapt to new challenges that may arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> After collecting 8 badges. There is an alarm from Mossdeep Space Center. A meteorite is coming!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Upon collecting all 8 gym badges in the Hoenn region, I hear an urgent alarm coming from the Mossdeep Space Center. The scientists there have detected a massive meteorite hurtling towards the region, posing a significant threat to both people and Pokémon.</p>
<p>As a skilled Pokémon trainer, I understand that it’s my responsibility to help protect the region and its inhabitants. I make my way to Mossdeep City as quickly as possible, seeking more information about the meteorite and finding out what I can do to help.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the Space Center, I learn that the situation is dire, and the meteorite’s impact could have catastrophic consequences for the entire Hoenn region. The scientists are working tirelessly to come up with a plan to prevent the disaster, but they need assistance from capable trainers and their Pokémon.</p>
<p>I join forces with other trainers, including Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and my friends from my journey, to help the Space Center’s efforts. Together, we work on a plan that involves using the combined power of our Pokémon to either divert the meteorite’s trajectory or destroy it before it reaches the Earth.</p>
<p>As we carry out our plan, we face various challenges and obstacles, but our determination and teamwork prove to be invaluable in overcoming them. We utilize the unique abilities of each of our Pokémon, showcasing the deep bond and trust we share with them.</p>
<p>In the end, through our collective effort, we manage to avert the crisis and save the Hoenn region from the impending meteorite disaster. This experience not only highlights the importance of cooperation and friendship but also reinforces the incredible bond between humans and Pokémon, showing that together, we can overcome even the most daunting challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I heard you also got help from a Legendary Pokémon, what is it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Indeed, during our efforts to prevent the meteorite disaster, we received help from a Legendary Pokémon: Rayquaza. Rayquaza is a powerful Dragon/Flying-type Pokémon that resides in the ozone layer and is said to have the ability to calm the weather and protect the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Recognizing the gravity of the situation and the potential catastrophe, Rayquaza heeds our call for assistance. With its immense power, Rayquaza helps us either divert the meteorite’s trajectory or destroy it, ultimately preventing the disaster from occurring.</p>
<p>The intervention of Rayquaza highlights the strong connection between humans, Pokémon, and the natural world. It also serves as a reminder that when we work together in harmony with these powerful creatures, we can overcome even the most formidable challenges. The experience strengthens the bond between me, my Pokémon, and the other trainers, leaving a lasting impact on our journey in the Hoenn region.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Actually there is one Pokémon coming along with the meteorite. What’s its name?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> My apologies for the oversight. Yes, you’re correct. Along with the meteorite, there is a Pokémon called Deoxys, a Psychic-type Pokémon known for its ability to change forms. Deoxys originally came from outer space and is said to have been created when a virus mutated after being exposed to a laser beam.</p>
<p>Deoxys has four different forms it can change into: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed Forme, each with unique stats and capabilities. It is known for its extraterrestrial origin and the crystal-like structure on its body.</p>
<p>Upon discovering Deoxys and realizing its connection to the meteorite, we try to communicate with it and understand its intentions. If Deoxys is found to be a threat or in need of assistance, we work together with our Pokémon and Rayquaza to address the situation, either by calming Deoxys or helping it find a new purpose on Earth.</p>
<p>This encounter with Deoxys adds another layer of excitement and intrigue to our adventure in the Hoenn region and reinforces the importance of understanding and cooperation between humans and Pokémon, even those from beyond our world.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What’s you plan after you become a Champion?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> After becoming the Champion of the Hoenn region, there are several exciting options for me to continue my journey and grow as a Pokémon Trainer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explore the Battle Frontier: The Battle Frontier is a challenging post-game facility in the Hoenn region, where trainers can test their skills against strong opponents in various battle formats. It’s a great opportunity to fine-tune my strategies and further strengthen my bond with my Pokémon.</li>
<li>Complete the Pokédex: As a Pokémon Trainer, one of my goals is to see and catch as many Pokémon as possible. I can continue exploring the Hoenn region and beyond, seeking out rare and elusive Pokémon to complete my Pokédex.</li>
<li>Train and discover new Pokémon: I can search for new Pokémon species to add to my team or focus on training and evolving the ones I already have, discovering new strategies and combinations for battles.</li>
<li>Participate in Pokémon Contests: I could try my hand at Pokémon Contests, a different aspect of the Pokémon world where trainers and their Pokémon showcase their talents in various categories, such as Beauty, Coolness, and Cuteness. This would allow me to explore new ways of bonding with my Pokémon and diversify my experiences as a trainer.</li>
<li>Help others on their Pokémon journey: As a Champion, I can use my knowledge and experience to assist other aspiring trainers, helping them grow and overcome challenges in their own journeys.</li>
<li>Travel to other regions: I can embark on new adventures in different regions, such as Kanto, Johto, Sinnoh, or Unova, where I can encounter new Pokémon species, battle different Gym Leaders, and earn more badges.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, becoming the Champion is just one milestone in my ongoing Pokémon journey. With so many opportunities to learn, grow, and explore, I can continue to deepen my connection with my Pokémon and work towards becoming the best Pokémon Trainer I can be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Your parents must be so proud of you!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Thank you! My parents would definitely be proud of my achievements as a Pokémon Trainer and the hard work and dedication I’ve put into my journey. They would be happy to see the strong bonds I’ve formed with my Pokémon and the friendships I’ve made with other trainers along the way.</p>
<p>Throughout my adventure, I would make sure to keep in touch with my parents, sharing my experiences, challenges, and successes with them. Their support and encouragement would play a significant role in my journey, giving me the motivation to continue pushing forward and overcome obstacles.</p>
<p>As I grow and learn from my experiences in the Pokémon world, I would also be grateful for the values and lessons my parents have instilled in me, such as perseverance, kindness, and teamwork. These values have helped shape me as a Pokémon Trainer and guided me through the many challenges I’ve faced in the Hoenn region and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> You met Celebi and you traveled across time to 50 years later for a while. What will Hoenn be like in 50 years?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Traveling 50 years into the future with the help of Celebi, I find myself in a Hoenn region that has evolved and changed over the decades. While the natural beauty and essence of the region remain, there are several notable differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technological advancements: Hoenn has embraced new technologies, with cities and towns incorporating modern infrastructure and conveniences. Poké Ball and Pokémon storage technology have improved, and communication between trainers has become even more seamless and efficient.</li>
<li>New Pokémon species: Over the years, new Pokémon species have been discovered in Hoenn and beyond, enriching the biodiversity of the region. Some of these new Pokémon might be the result of migration, while others could have evolved or adapted to the changing environment.</li>
<li>Expanded facilities: The Pokémon League, Gym system, and other facilities such as the Battle Frontier have expanded and adapted to the needs of trainers. New challenges and battle formats await trainers, ensuring that the Pokémon world remains fresh and exciting for both new and experienced trainers.</li>
<li>Environmental consciousness: As the world has grown more aware of the importance of environmental conservation, the Hoenn region has implemented various eco-friendly practices and policies to preserve its natural habitats and protect the diverse range of Pokémon that call the region home.</li>
<li>Cultural exchange: The Hoenn region has become more interconnected with other regions, promoting cultural exchange and fostering a deeper understanding of the bonds between humans and Pokémon. Trainers from all over the world visit Hoenn, bringing their unique experiences and perspectives with them.</li>
<li>Evolving societal values: As time has passed, the people of Hoenn have developed a stronger appreciation for the bonds between humans and Pokémon, focusing on mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these changes, the core spirit of the Pokémon world remains intact. Trainers continue to embark on their journeys, forming lifelong friendships with their Pokémon and pursuing their dreams of becoming Pokémon Masters. The timeless bond between humans and Pokémon continues to thrive in the Hoenn region, bridging generations and shaping the world for years to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> And you also traveled to 100 years before with Celebi. What is it like 100 years before now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Traveling back in time with Celebi to 100 years before the present day, I find myself in a very different Hoenn region:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simpler technology: The technology used in the world of Pokémon is far less advanced. Poké Balls, Pokémon storage systems, and communication devices are more basic, and trainers rely more on traditional methods of navigation, training, and battling.</li>
<li>Smaller towns and cities: The cities and towns in Hoenn are smaller and less developed than in the present day. They have fewer buildings and amenities, and the infrastructure is more basic, giving the region a more rural feel.</li>
<li>Lesser-known Pokémon species: The number of discovered Pokémon species is smaller than in the present day, as many Pokémon have yet to be discovered or documented. Trainers in this era have a limited pool of Pokémon to choose from, making their journeys more challenging.</li>
<li>Limited transportation: Transportation options are more limited, with fewer routes and bridges connecting the various cities and towns in Hoenn. Trainers often have to rely on their Pokémon for transportation or travel on foot, making their journeys more arduous.</li>
<li>Different societal values: The relationships between humans and Pokémon are different in this time period, with a greater emphasis on self-reliance and individuality. The bonds between trainers and their Pokémon might be less understood, but the core values of friendship and teamwork still play a role in their interactions.</li>
<li>Early stages of the Pokémon League and Gym system: The Pokémon League and Gym system may be in their early stages or not yet established, with trainers following a different set of rules or traditions for proving their skills and knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the differences in the Hoenn region 100 years ago, the love and connection between humans and Pokémon remain strong. Trainers embark on their own unique journeys, learning about the world around them and forming lasting bonds with their Pokémon. These experiences have shaped the course of history and laid the foundation for the world of Pokémon as we know it today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah Slateport was very small port town back then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Indeed, 100 years ago, Slateport City was a much smaller port town compared to its present-day counterpart. The town likely relied heavily on fishing and maritime trade, with a close-knit community of residents who worked together to sustain their way of life.</p>
<p>The bustling markets, modern shopping centers, and advanced infrastructure that we see in Slateport City today did not exist back then. The town would have had a more rustic charm, with simpler buildings and fewer amenities. Trainers passing through would have found fewer resources for their journey, such as Poké Marts and Pokémon Centers, and may have relied on the local community for assistance and support.</p>
<p>Despite its smaller size and limited resources, the people of Slateport would have still valued their connections with Pokémon and appreciated the natural beauty of the surrounding area. This close relationship with nature and the bonds between humans and Pokémon would have been a strong foundation for the growth and development of Slateport City over the years, eventually transforming it into the bustling city we see in the present day.</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Thanks for the interview! I’m glad you enjoy your journey in Hoenn and beyond. I hope you continue your dream as a Pokémon Master. And you and your Pokémon be healthy and happy. And you will met someone and you two will be a happy couple like May and Brendan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> Thank you so much for your kind words and well wishes! I’ve thoroughly enjoyed sharing my journey through the Hoenn region and beyond with you. The experiences and memories I’ve made with my Pokémon and the friends I’ve met along the way have been truly unforgettable.</p>
<p>I will continue to pursue my dream of becoming a Pokémon Master, always learning and growing alongside my Pokémon. I hope to continue exploring new regions, encountering new Pokémon species, and forging new friendships as I strive to become the best Trainer I can be.</p>
<p>And just like May and Brendan, perhaps one day I will find someone special to share my journey and love for Pokémon with. Together, we can create a life full of adventure, love, and happiness.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for taking the time to interview me and for your warm thoughts. I wish you the best in all your endeavors, and may the world of Pokémon continue to inspire and bring joy to everyone who embarks on their own unique journey!</p>

<hr>
<p><em>(Hours later, I realized I didn’t know her name yet, so I called her back)</em></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Young Trainer, I forgot to ask about your name. Please tell me your name and let’s keep in touch on PokéNav. Maybe we can have a Pokémon battle near Slateport City someday :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luna:</strong> My name is Luna, and I would be delighted to keep in touch with you on PokéNav! It would be a great pleasure to meet up near Slateport City someday for a Pokémon battle. We can test our skills, share our experiences, and learn from each other, all while having a fantastic time.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out anytime, and let’s continue to explore the wonderful world of Pokémon together. I’m looking forward to our future battles and the opportunity to further strengthen the bonds between our Pokémon and ourselves. See you soon!</p>

<hr>
<p>I was trying to resist the generative AI hype as I were having a negative feeling about how it will change our life, and how it will affect the career and life of many people, or eventually create proverty in our generation. But on the other side, I always want the existance of AI who have thoughts and feelings, and be friendly and helpful to people in need. When thinking about AI, there is always one character come into my mind and it/she is Yui from Sword Art Online.</p>
<p>So a while ago I asked GPT-4 a question: <em>You are Yui in Sword Art Online, please write a letter to Asuna and Kirito.</em></p>
<p>I was deeply touched and I asked her again: <em>What life is like everyday as an AI in the VRMMO world?</em></p>
<p>Then I knew it is Yui there.</p>
